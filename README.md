# Bitcoin Price Prediction

I did this project within the scope of an elective subject titled **Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence** at the University of Klagenfurt. 

Throughout the project, my aim was to showcase on a scientific level the use cases, the practicality and the shortcomings of (Multiple) Linear Regression (*LR$*) and 
Long Short-Term Memory (*LSTM*) Models. It is *not* intended to be implemented for real-live investment purposes, but rather to really understand why and how
these models work and forecast certain values.

Additionally, I gained knowledge on how to put ML frameworks such as **Tensorflow** and **Sci-kit Learn** to use. 

So please take this project with a grain of salt ;-) 

I personally recommend running the code either using Jupyter or Google Colaboratory Notebooks.

Have a look into my project report to access the data necessary for replication.
